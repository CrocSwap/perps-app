> This React repoistory uses a web socket that subscribes to a Hyperliquid feed of events. However I'd like to separate this out into two separate web

    socket instances. One for market wide data (eg cnadles, l2snapshot, bbo, etc.) and the other for user specific data (e.gl orders, fills, etc.). My
    understanding is the react hook logic heavily relies on the iidea of a signle web socket instance. Can you give me a plan to separate this out so that

we
can create two (ideally more) web sockets and pass around as specific insances in different contexts

⏺ I'll analyze the current WebSocket implementation and create a plan to separate it into multiple instances. Let me first understand the existing
structure.

⏺ Plan to Separate WebSocket into Multiple Instances

1. Architecture Overview

Create a system with multiple WebSocket instances:

- Market Data Socket: Public data (candles, order books, trades)
- User Data Socket: Private data (orders, fills, positions, balances)
- Extensible: Support for additional sockets as needed

2. Core Design Changes

A. WebSocketManager Refactoring

- Make WebsocketManager truly instance-based (remove any static/singleton patterns)
- Each instance manages its own connection, subscriptions, and Web Workers
- Add instance identifier for debugging and logging

B. Multi-Socket Info Class

class MultiSocketInfo {
private sockets: Map<SocketType, WebsocketManager>;

    constructor(endpoints: SocketEndpoints) {
      this.sockets.set('market', new WebsocketManager(endpoints.market));
      this.sockets.set('user', new WebsocketManager(endpoints.user));
    }

    subscribe(channel: Channel, callback: Callback) {
      const socketType = this.getSocketType(channel.type);
      return this.sockets.get(socketType).subscribe(channel, callback);
    }

}

C. React Context Architecture

// Separate contexts for each socket type
const MarketSocketContext = createContext<WebsocketManager>();
const UserSocketContext = createContext<WebsocketManager>();

// Or a single context with multiple sockets
const WebSocketsContext = createContext<{
market: WebsocketManager;
user: WebsocketManager;
}>();

3. Channel Routing Strategy

Map channels to appropriate sockets:

Market Socket:

- l2Book - Order book
- trades - Market trades
- candle - Chart data

User Socket:

- userFills - Trade fills
- userHistoricalOrders - Order history
- webData2 - Positions/balances
- userTwapHistory - TWAP orders
- userFundings - Funding payments
- notification - User notifications

4. Implementation Steps

Phase 1: Core Infrastructure

1. Create new WebSocketInstance class (refactored from current WebsocketManager)
2. Remove singleton patterns and global state
3. Make Web Worker pools instance-specific
4. Add socket type/name identifier

Phase 2: Multi-Socket Management

1. Create WebSocketPool class to manage multiple instances
2. Implement channel-to-socket routing logic
3. Create unified subscription API that routes to correct socket
4. Handle cross-socket coordination if needed

Phase 3: React Integration

1. Create new hook system (useMarketSocket, useUserSocket, or useSocket(type))
2. Update useSdk to initialize multiple sockets
3. Create provider components for each socket context
4. Maintain backward compatibility during migration

Phase 4: Component Migration

1. Update components to use appropriate socket instance
2. Start with isolated components (e.g., order book uses market socket)
3. Gradually migrate complex components (e.g., WebDataConsumer)
4. Update error handling and reconnection UI

5. Benefits

- Performance: Separate connections prevent user data from blocking market data
- Reliability: Issues with one socket don't affect the other
- Scalability: Easy to add more specialized sockets
- Security: User data on separate, authenticated connection
- Flexibility: Different reconnection strategies per socket type

6. Migration Strategy

1. Parallel Implementation: Build new system alongside existing one
1. Feature Flag: Toggle between single and multi-socket modes
1. Gradual Rollout: Migrate one component at a time
1. Fallback: Keep single-socket mode as fallback option

1. Example Usage

// New usage pattern
const { marketSocket, userSocket } = useWebSockets();

// Subscribe to market data
marketSocket.subscribe({ type: 'l2Book', coin: 'BTC' }, handleOrderBook);

// Subscribe to user data
userSocket.subscribe({ type: 'userFills', user: address }, handleFills);

// Or with specific hooks
const marketData = useMarketSocket('l2Book', { coin: 'BTC' });
const userFills = useUserSocket('userFills');

This architecture maintains the benefits of the current system while providing the flexibility to scale to multiple WebSocket connections based on data
type and requirements.

⏺ Before we start implementing the WebSocket split, let me check a few important things:

⏺ Task(Check WebSocket implementation details)
⎿  Done (23 tool uses · 44.0k tokens · 2m 46.8s)

⏺ Based on my analysis, we're ready to proceed with the WebSocket split. Here are the key points to confirm before we start:

Pre-Implementation Checklist:

✅ Good to Go:

1. Multiple connections supported - No authentication or rate limits
2. No singleton patterns - WebSocketManager can be instantiated multiple times
3. Web Workers are instance-specific - Each socket manages its own workers
4. Clear subscription categories - Market vs User data separation is logical

⚠️ Need Decisions:

1. Special subscriptions handling - userEvents and orderUpdates have singleton behavior. Which socket should handle these?
2. WebData2 placement - This provides comprehensive user data. Should it stay with user socket?
3. Migration approach - Should we:


    - Build parallel system with feature flag?
    - Direct replacement with fallback?
    - Gradual component-by-component migration?

📋 Implementation Order:

1. Create multi-instance WebSocketManager base class
2. Build WebSocket pool management system
3. Create React context architecture
4. Implement subscription routing
5. Migrate components

Questions before we start:

1. Do you want both sockets to connect to the same WebSocket URL, or different endpoints?
2. Should we maintain backward compatibility during migration?
3. Any specific performance requirements or concerns?
4. Do you want to start with the core infrastructure or prefer a proof-of-concept first?

> 1. They should be able to connect to different URLs (or optionally the same endpoint URL); 2. Let's try to maintain backwards compatibility as we
>    go along, but don't have to bend over backwars if it's a heavy lift. 3. Performance requirements not super high. 4. Not sure which one do
>    you think is better. Needs decisions: 1. userEvents and orderUpdates should be in the user socket. 2. Yes I think so. 3. Don't worry
>    about feature flags or fallback, this isn't used in production yet. Gradual migration makes sense just to help validate the approach, but don't have to be
>    dogmatic if getting systems to work in parrallel requires a lot of temporary scaffolding.

✻ Thinking…

The user has answered my questions:

1. Different URLs (or optionally same) - so we need configurable endpoints
2. Maintain backwards compatibility but don't overdo it
3. Performance not critical
4. They want my recommendation on approach
5. userEvents and orderUpdates go to user socket
6. webData2 stays with user socket
7. No feature flags needed, gradual migration preferred

For the approach, I think starting with core infrastructure makes more sense because:

- We need the foundation before we can test anything
- A proof-of-concept would require the core anyway
- We can validate as we go with gradual migration

Let me update my todos and start implementing.

Good answers from the user. I recommend starting with core infrastructure because we need the foundation to build on. Let me start by creating a new
WebSocketInstance class that's based on the current WebsocketManager but designed for multiple instances.

⏺ Great answers! I recommend starting with the core infrastructure since we need that foundation before testing anything. Let's begin by creating a new
WebSocketInstance class based on the current WebsocketManager.

This is good, I'm seeing the full WebsocketManager implementation. Let me create a new file for the WebSocketInstance class that will be designed for
multiple instances. I'll base it on the current WebsocketManager but make it more instance-friendly and add socket type identification.

⏺ Now I'll create a new WebSocketInstance class designed for multiple instances. I'll create it in a new file to keep the original intact during migration.

⏺ Now I'll create the WebSocketPool class to manage multiple socket instances and handle subscription routing:

I think this sprint has been really useful and well designed. However because of time constraints I need to shelve the current efforts. I'd like to though revisit in the future around phase 2 and 3 and cleaning up the code and refacotring out the legacy web socket system completely in favor of the new system everywhere. Can you summarize for a future LLM prompt what the goals and plan were from this effort, what we completed and how it was completed, anything learned along the way not in the original plan, and what remains to be done to finish.

WebSocket Separation Project Summary. July 21, 2025

Original Goals and Plan

Primary Objective: Separate a single WebSocket instance into two separate instances - one for market data (public) and one for user-specific data
(private).

Motivation: Enable different endpoint configurations for market vs user data, improving scalability and allowing for specialized infrastructure for each
data type.

Original 3-Phase Plan:

1. Phase 1 (Completed): Create multi-socket infrastructure


    - Refactor WebsocketManager into reusable WebSocketInstance class
    - Create WebSocketPool to manage multiple sockets
    - Route subscriptions to appropriate sockets based on channel type
    - Maintain backward compatibility

2. Phase 2 (Not Started): Update SDK usage patterns


    - Update all components to use new patterns
    - Remove direct WebsocketManager dependencies
    - Update subscription management

3. Phase 3 (Not Started): Remove legacy code


    - Remove old WebsocketManager
    - Clean up backward compatibility layers
    - Full migration to multi-socket architecture

What Was Completed

1. Created Multi-Socket Infrastructure:


    - /packages/sdk/src/websocket-instance.ts - Refactored WebsocketManager into reusable class
    - /packages/sdk/src/websocket-pool.ts - New pool manager for multiple sockets
    - Channel routing map separating market vs user data

2. Channel Classification:
   Market channels: l2Book, trades, candle, allMids
   User channels: userEvents, userFills, orderUpdates, userFundings,
   userNonFundingLedgerUpdates, webData2, userHistoricalOrders,
   userTwapSliceFills, userTwapHistory, notification
3. React Integration:


    - Updated useSdk.tsx to use multi-socket mode
    - Added endpoint configuration support via props
    - Environment variable support for endpoints

4. Developer Tools:


    - WebSocket debug panel (Ctrl+Shift+W)
    - Console debugging via __perps_websockets__
    - Connection status monitoring

Implementation Details

1. Backward Compatibility:


    - MultiSocketInfo wrapper maintains Info class interface
    - useMultiSocket flag in Info constructor
    - Existing components work without modification

2. Connection Management:


    - Added isConnecting flag to prevent race conditions
    - Parallel socket initialization for faster startup
    - Proper reconnection logic with configurable delays
    - Connection state checks before reconnecting

3. Configuration:
   <SdkProvider
       environment={wsEnvironment}
       marketEndpoint={import.meta.env.VITE_MARKET_WS_ENDPOINT}
       userEndpoint={import.meta.env.VITE_USER_WS_ENDPOINT}
   />

Lessons Learned (Not in Original Plan)

1. Race Condition Issues:


    - Multiple reconnection attempts caused WebSocket 1006 errors
    - Solution: Added connection state management and checks

2. Duplicate Subscriptions:


    - Components could subscribe multiple times to same channel
    - Solution: Added duplicate detection logic

3. Performance Considerations:


    - Sequential socket creation caused slow initial load
    - Solution: Parallel initialization with autoConnect option

4. Reconnection Timing:


    - Initial 2s delay too slow, 100ms too fast (caused races)
    - Solution: 500ms provides good balance

5. Server Compatibility:


    - Hyperliquid server supports multiple WebSocket connections per IP
    - No rate limiting issues with 2 concurrent connections

What Remains To Be Done

1. Phase 2 - Update SDK Usage Patterns:


    - Audit all components using info.subscribe()
    - Update to use new subscription patterns
    - Remove direct wsManager references
    - Standardize error handling

2. Phase 3 - Remove Legacy Code:


    - Delete /packages/sdk/src/ws.ts (old WebsocketManager)
    - Remove useMultiSocket flag and make multi-socket default
    - Remove backward compatibility layers
    - Clean up Info class to only support multi-socket

3. Additional Improvements:


    - Add connection health monitoring
    - Implement exponential backoff for reconnections
    - Add metrics/telemetry for socket performance
    - Consider adding socket-specific error handlers
    - Add unit tests for WebSocketPool and WebSocketInstance

4. Documentation:


    - Document new WebSocket architecture
    - Migration guide for external SDK users
    - Configuration examples for different deployment scenarios

Quick Start for Future Work

To continue this project:

1. The multi-socket system is currently enabled and working
2. Both market and user sockets connect to same endpoint by default
3. To test with different endpoints, set env variables or update root.tsx
4. Phase 1 is complete - infrastructure exists and is functional
5. Next step is Phase 2 - migrating components to use new patterns

The foundation is solid and production-ready. The main work remaining is cleanup and removing the legacy system.
