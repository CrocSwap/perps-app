# Perps SDK

An SDK for interacting with the Ambient Perps API.

## Introduction

The SDK includes 2 public components:

- `Info`: A class for fetching and subscribing to data from the API.
- `Exchange`: A class for querying or mutating the state of the DEX.

Currently, all the mutation methods are mocked and do not interact with the real DEX. The signing methods are not implemented yet.
