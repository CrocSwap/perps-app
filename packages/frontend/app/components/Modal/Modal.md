# Modal

## Instructions

1. Import the `useModal()` hook into your React functional component. This file contains logic to related to opening and closing the modal.
2. Import `Modal.tsx` into your React functional component. This is a wrapper which instantiates its children as a modal in the DOM.
3. Create an instantiation of `<Modal>{children}</Modal>` in the React component's return statement. Position in DOM nesting does not matter.
